              This page is a demonstration of knowledge acquired from the "Prework" of the Software Engineering course in <a href="https://flatironschool.com/">FlatIron School.</a> The Prework consisted of learning about the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
            It is with these languages that I am able to use this webpage to introduce myself.
